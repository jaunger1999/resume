* First item

* Item with [link](http://www.example.com). Links will work both in
  the html and pdf versions.

Technical Experience
--------------------

Hobbyist Game Development
:   During my summers I have made three games playable to completion and prototyped many more.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Programming Languages
:   **C#:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **Java:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   Basic knowledge of **C, C++, Ruby**
